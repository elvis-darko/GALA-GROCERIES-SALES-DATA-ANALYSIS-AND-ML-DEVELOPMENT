## NOTES ON DATASETS


## TASKS
**TASK 1 : EXPLORATORY DATA ANALYSIS**
- Explore the client’s sales data as part of the Data Science team at Cognizant.
- Communicate findings and recommendations in an email to the Data Science team leader.

**TASK 2 : DATA MODELING**
- Review a data model diagram provided by the Data Engineering team and create a strategic plan as to how you’ll use this data to answer the problem statement.
- Summarize the choices and plan of work in a PowerPoint presentation.

**TASK 3 : MODEL BUILDING AND INTERPRETATION**
- Combine, transform and model the datasets in a suitable way to answer the problem statement that the business has requested.
- Communicate your work and analysis in the form of a PowerPoint slide to present the results back to the business.

**TASK 4 : MACHINE LEARNING PRODUCTION**
- Prepare a Python module that contains code to train a model and output the performance metrics for the Machine Learning engineering team.


## SCREESHOTS OF DEPLOYED APP


# SETUP
It is recommended to have Virtual Studio Code or any other standard code editor on your local machine.<br />Install the required packages locally to your computer.

It is recommended that you run a python version 3.0 and above. 
You can download the required python version from [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

Use these recommended steps to set up your local machine for this project:

1. **Clone the repo :** To clone this repo, copy the url and paste it in your GitHub desktop or code editor on your local machine.
        
        https://github.com/elvis-darko/Team_Zurich_Capstone_Project.git

1. **Create the Python's virtual environment :** <br />This will isolate the required libraries of the project to avoid conflicts.<br />Choose any of the line of code that will work on your local machine.

            python3 -m venv venv
            python -m venv venv


2. **Activate the Python's virtual environment :**<br />This will ensure that the Python kernel & libraries will be those of the created isolated environment.

            - for windows : 
                         venv\Scripts\activate

            - for Linux & MacOS :
                         source venv/bin/activate


3. **Upgrade Pip :**<br />Pip is the installed libraries/packages manager. Upgrading Pip will give an to up-to-date version that will work correctly.

            python -m pip install --upgrade pip


4. **Install the required libraries/packages :**<br />There are libraries and packages that are required for this project. These libraries and packages are listed in the `requirements.txt` file.<br />The text file will allow you to import these libraries and packages into the python's scripts and notebooks without any issue.

            python -m pip install -r requirements.txt 

# MACHINE LEARNING MODEL DEPLOYMENT
## Run Streamlit App
A streamlit app was added for further exploration of the model. The streamlit app provides a simple Graphic User Interface where predicitons can be made from inputs.

- Run the demo app (being at the root of the repository):
        
        Streamlit run streamlit.app.py
